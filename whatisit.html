            <p> One day I sat with someone in the bus. I didn't know him and he didn't know me, yet we started randomly talking. Turns out we were doing different courses but going to the same lecture. The lecture was boring, but after it we went to get a coffee since we had a spare hour. We found even though we were completely different people (different subjects, nationalities, friendship groups...) we got along really nicely because we shared similar mindsets on some things. <br><br> You see; I love camper vans, pasta, talking about placements, planes (love planes), football... but above it all, I love talking about stuff - anything really, as long as it is engaging and carries passion.<br><br> That hour we spoke was completely organic, no common friends made us meet, we weren't forced to sit together - it was just a random yes which lead to a genuinely interesting conversation. I was so happy about the fact that I just talked to a complete stranger. I had found something. <br><br> We all have aquaintances, people we sit with on lectures, neighours... All we lack socially are those people that are just cool people, that have a passion, that talk about things that matter to them - people we make time for just to be able to share a chat with, because its interesting, motivating, fun. <br><br> With this little story in mind I decided to start a platform where people from the same university can just meet and share a chat, just because they were both free at the same time. No need to sign up, no need to filter users - none of that. Only people that find the idea cool will do it - so therefore one will only meet cool people. This should be the real-life fight club, the Linkedin of cool people, a creative social network, a place for people to create, think and be themselves. I hope you enjoy it. <br> <br> <br>

            <p> English isn't my native language, so I was introduced to the word "howdy hey" by some friends as this nice, warm, welcoming phrase that friends say to each other. When I came to university I found it so difficult to say 'howdy' to people. It is discribed as this over-friendly word - and for this purpose it is exactly what you need. When I use Howdy Hey and meet new people be over-friendly, outgoing, step out of you comfort zone, talk about your stuff, listen to other people's stuff. If I hadn't followed those guidelines I would've never had that coffee with the bus stranger.</p> <br> <br> <br>
